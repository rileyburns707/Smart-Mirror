# Smart-Mirror

# Project Summary
This is a Smart Mirror with MagicMirror software, a motion sensor, and LEDs connected to a dimmer button!

I designed and built a Smart Mirror with a custom wooden frame, 23” x 23” acrylic, LED strips connected to a dimmer control, PIR motion sensor, Acer monitor, and all connected through a Raspberry Pi 2 model B. The size of the mirror including the frame is 26" x 26 "

# File/Folder Details
The config.js file is the configuration file for the MagicMirror software. The software contains default modules such as time, date, and newsfeed. Other modules such as the weather display, fish of the day, custom compliments that change depending on the time of day, pen plot art, and the PIR motion sensor module are all additional modules that I added. These are open-source modules that can be located on the modules page on the magicmirror—builders website.

The images folder contains pictures of the front and back of the smart mirror. There are 3 images of the front of the mirror in different states and 2 images of the back of the mirror. For more details on the pictures look at the image_explanations.md file in the folder!
