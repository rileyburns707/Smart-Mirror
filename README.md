# Smart-Mirror

# Project Summary
This is a Smart Mirror with MagicMirror software, a motion sensor, and LEDs connected to a dimmer button!

I designed and built a Smart Mirror with a custom wooden frame, LED strips connected to a dimmer control, PIR motion sensor, Acer monitor, and all connected through a Raspberry Pi 2 model B. 

# File Details
The config.js file is the configuration file for the MagicMirror software. The software contains default modules such as time, date, and newsfeed. Other modules such as the weather display, fish of the day, custom compliments that change depending on the time of day, pen plot art, and the PIR motion sensor module are all additional modules that I added. These are open-source modules that can be located on the modules page on the magicmirrorâ€”builders website.
