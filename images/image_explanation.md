# Image Explanations

## Front 1
This picture displays the front of the mirror when completely off. A smart mirror is still a mirror at the end of the day, so it is just a mirror. Note the LED button in the top right as well as the PIR motion sensor in the middle at the top of the frame. This photo gives a good view of what the front features look like.

## Front 2
This picture shows the mirror's appearance when the screen and LEDs are turned on. The LEDs are very bright in the photo but in person, they do not shine that bright. You can see a good view of the display. The light blue circle in the top right is the LED dimmer button when turned on. 

## Front 3
This picture gives a good view of how the mirror looks during the evening when the LEDs are turned off. This is where the smart mirror becomes more of a display rather than a mirror because you cannot see your reflection. 

## Back 1
This photo gives a clear view of the behind-the-scenes in the mirror. The taping is there to hold all the wires in place. The wood beams going horizontally in the middle help hold the monitor in place. This smart mirror can be hung up, it is heavy because of all the electronics, but the wood frame is simple to hang. 

## Back 2
This is the same picture as 'back 1' with the only difference being I have labeled certain parts of the mirror to help give a better understanding of what things are.
